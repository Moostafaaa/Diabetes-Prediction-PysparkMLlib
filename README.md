# Diabetes-Prediction-PysparkMLlib
Project Structure
The hands on project on Diabetes Prediction With Pyspark MLLIB is divided into following tasks:

# Task 1: Introduction & Install Dependencies                   
Introduction to the Purpose of the Project and the Dataset.

Introduction to the Rhyme Interface.

Install Pyspark on the Google Colab Environment

Create and Run a Spark Session 

# Task 2: Clone and Explore the Dataset
Clone the Diabetes Dataset from Github Repository

Working with Pyspark Dataframe

Explore the Dataset to get the total number of rows and columns , extract meaningful information from the dataset, and analyze Summary Statistics.

# Task 3: Data Cleaning and Preparation
Check for null values (if present)

Remove or replace unnecessary values present in the dataset 

# Task 4: Correlation Analysis and Feature Selection
Correlation analysis among the input and the output variables.

Selection of the input features 

# Task 5: Build a Logistic Regression Classifier
Split the Dataset into Training and Testing Set

Build and train the Logistic Regression Model

# Task 6: Evaluate & Save the Model
Evaluate and Test the model on the Test Data

Save the Model to the disk

Load the saved Logistic Regression Model on Colab to further predict on the new set of data

# Task 7: Model Prediction on a New Set of Unlabelled Data
Create a Spark Dataframe

Use the Saved Model to Predict Diabetes on the New Set of Test Data
